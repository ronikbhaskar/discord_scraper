# DISCLAIMER

Botting your Discord account violates their Terms of Service. I do not use this scraper, nor will I, and I recommend you never use it either. This is solely for educational purposes.

## Theoretical Use Cases

Hypothetically speaking, wouldn't it be cool to go through your server's chat history, run the text through a Markov Chain generator, and spit out some nonsense for you all to laugh at? Just a thought. It would be tedious, copying every message by hand, but it's definitely doable, so that's how you should do it. By hand.

## Getting your Access Token

Now, having access to the Discord API requires an Access Token, and no one would know how to get their access token. I mean, who is going to open Discord in Chrome, open the inspector, switch to mobile/tablet display, go to the Application tab, find the sidebar section labeled Storage, select https://discord.com from the Local Storage dropdown, search token, and copy the value from the Key-Value pair? That's a ridiculous number of hoops to jump through, and I can't imagine anyone figuring that out on their own.
